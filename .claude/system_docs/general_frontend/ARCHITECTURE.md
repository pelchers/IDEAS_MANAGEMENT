## Orchestrator → Subagent Flow

```mermaid

    participant U as User
    participant O as Orchestrator
    participant S as Subagent (×N)
    participant P as Playwright

    U->>O: "Generate 2 brutalist passes for dashboard app"
    O->>O: Parse styles + pass count from prompt
    O->>O: Read style-config.json for style definitions
    O->>O: Assign unique core flags per pass (anti-convergence)
    O->>O: Write README spec per pass with assigned flags

    loop Per batch (up to 4 parallel)
        O->>S: Dispatch with README spec
        S->>S: Plan approach from spec
        S->>S: Validate CDN library URLs
        S->>S: Generate HTML/CSS/JS files (10 views)
        S->>P: Run Playwright validation
        P-->>S: Screenshots + report
        S->>S: Review output against spec
        S->>S: Fix issues if needed
        S-->>O: Complete signal
    end

    O->>O: Verify all passes have 20 required files
    O->>O: Write summary index
    O-->>U: Report: N passes complete, paths provided
```

## Anti-Convergence System

The orchestrator assigns uniqueness flags to prevent passes within the same style group from looking alike:

**Orchestrator-assigned (structural — prevent layout duplication):**
- Layout archetype: sidebar-driven | full-bleed-immersive | dashboard-grid | editorial-column | card-mosaic
- Navigation model: persistent-left-rail | floating-fab-menu | hamburger-drawer | top-tabs | breadcrumb-tree
- Information density: minimal | balanced | data-rich
- Animation philosophy: static | subtle | expressive
- Color temperature: warm | cool | neutral | high-contrast

**Subagent-assigned (creative — within structural constraints):**
- Typography pairing, grid system, interaction signature, visual motif, spacing rhythm, micro-interaction style

## Output File Requirements (20 per pass)

## Subagent Self-Validation Loop

Each subagent runs its own validation cycle before reporting complete:

```
Generate → Validate (Playwright) → Review results → Fix issues → Re-validate → Done
```

Subagent does not mark complete until Playwright screenshots confirm visual output.

## Error Handling

| Error | Trigger | Action |
|-------|---------|--------|
| CDN library 404 | Validation fetches fail | Try alternate CDN; use local equivalent |
| Playwright screenshot blank | Rendering error | Check browser console, fix JS errors |
| Pass convergence detected | Two passes share layout archetype | Reassign orchestrator flags before dispatch |
| Missing required files | Pass has <20 files at completion | Orchestrator flags pass as incomplete |
| Subagent exceeds context | Very large pass with many files | Split into two subagent calls |
